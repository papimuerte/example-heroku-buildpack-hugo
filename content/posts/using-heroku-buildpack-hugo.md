This is a [Heroku buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)
for sites powered by [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo).
It uses the latest stable version of Hugo.

Usage
===

Create a Heroku application using this buildpack:

```bash
$ heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/roperzh/heroku-buildpack-hugo.git
```

or configure your existent application:

```bash
$ heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL="https://github.com/roperzh/heroku-buildpack-hugo.git"
```

Then simply git push to heroku and open your application!

```bash
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

Using themes
===

This buildpack provides a simple api to use custom themes, just add a `.hugotheme`
file in the root of your application with the url of your theme.

***Example***

To fetch the great [hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde.git) theme:

```
https://github.com/spf13/hyde.git
```

[Here]() is an example application, and [here]() is the code.

Alternative method
---

If you don't like the idea of a `.hugotheme` file, you can simply manage your
themes with [git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).
Heroku will take care to fetch all the submodules in your project.

Important notes
===

Don't forget to configure your hugo `baseurl` with the url of your application.
